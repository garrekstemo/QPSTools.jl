# Fit Overlapping Peaks

When two or more peaks overlap, fitting them individually gives wrong widths and areas. Fit them simultaneously instead.

## Problem

A spectral region contains multiple peaks that are not fully resolved.

## Solution

### Specify the Number of Peaks

Use `n_peaks` to tell `fit_peaks` how many peaks to fit:

```julia
result = fit_peaks(spec, (1900, 2200); n_peaks=2)
```

The fitter detects peaks automatically for initial guesses and keeps the `n_peaks` most prominent ones. If auto-detection finds fewer peaks than requested, synthetic guesses fill the gaps.

### Inspect the Decomposition

Each peak is accessible by index:

```julia
result[1][:center].value    # first peak position
result[2][:center].value    # second peak position

predict_peak(result, 1)     # curve for peak 1
predict_peak(result, 2)     # curve for peak 2
predict_baseline(result)    # baseline only
```

### Visualize Individual Peaks

Use `plot_peak_decomposition!` to overlay individual curves on a plot:

```julia
fig = Figure(size=(700, 500))
ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel="Wavenumber (cm⁻¹)", ylabel="Intensity")
scatter!(ax, result._x, result._y, label="Data")
plot_peak_decomposition!(ax, result)
axislegend(ax)
save("figures/decomposition.pdf", fig)
```

Individual peaks are shown as dashed lines and the baseline as a dotted line.

### Control the Baseline

The polynomial baseline order defaults to 1 (linear). For a constant baseline or higher-order polynomial:

```julia
result = fit_peaks(spec, region; n_peaks=2, baseline_order=0)  # constant
result = fit_peaks(spec, region; n_peaks=2, baseline_order=2)  # quadratic
```

## Tips

- Start with `n_peaks=1` and increase only if residuals show systematic patterns
- If the fit doesn't converge well, try providing manual initial guesses (see [Provide Manual Initial Guesses](@ref))
- Use `report(result)` to see all peak parameters and fit quality at a glance
